            <h3>Abbas ibn Firnas 875 CE</h3>
            <p>Firnas, also known as Armen Firman, was an Andalusian polymath. He allegedly built a pair of wings and
                jumped from a tower somewhere in Córdoba. His wings allowed him to glide for a bit before crash-landing
                and injuring his back.</p>

            <h3>Flying Machine Designs 1488</h3>
            <p>For much of his life, <strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong> was fascinated by the phenomenon of flight. He
                produced many studies of the flight of birds, as well as plans for several flying machines, including a
                helicopter and a light hang glider.</p>

            <h3>The Leap of Faith 1742</h3>
            <p>The Marquis de Bacqueville attempted to fly across the Seines river. A few seconds into his flight, he
                lost control and crashed into a washerwoman's barge, breaking one of his legs.</p>

            <h3>First Manned Balloon 1783</h3>
            <p>The Montgolfier brothers, Joseph and Etienne, were French paper manufacturers with an interest in
                chemistry. Inspired by watching his wife's chemise inflate while drying by the hearth, Joseph conceived
                of a flying machine made out of very large paper bags filled with hot air. Their first manned flight was
                launched on November 21, 1783.</p>

                fins. It is unclear from the drawing and existing records how the fantastical apparatis was supposed to

            <p>The Aerial Steam Carriage was patented in 1842 by William Samuel Henson and John Stringfellow. It’s a
                monoplane that marked a transition from gliders to self-powered machines in the human quest for flight.

                glider. Le Bris was a French sailor and sea captain. He was the first to identify the concept of lift,
                which he called aspiration.</p>

                balloons which were subject to wind currents. Charles F. Ritchel called his machine the Dirigicycle, and
                made a handful of successful test flights in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. </p>

            <p>Otto Lilienthal, known as the "Flying Man", was a pioneer of aviation best known for his experiments with
                gliders. He made thousands of successful test flights throughout his career, and received patents for
                his deisgns, notably the "Normalsegelapparats", the first known aircraft to be serially produced.</p>

            <p>Brazilian aeronaut Alberto Santos-Dumont won the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize for creating the first
                machine capable of flying from the Aéro-Club de France's flying field to the Eiffel Tower, and back, in
                less than thirty minutes.</p>

            <h3>Wright Brothers 1903</h3>
            <p>Outside the town of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina on 17 December 1903, a flying machine lifted off the
                ground. It landed twelve seconds later and 120 feet away from its launch point. Orvil and Wilber Wright
                achieved a manned flight in a heavier-than-air craft under its own power, the first in history.</p>

            <p>On October 23, 1906, Alberto Santos-Dumont won a competition in Paris by flying his aircraft 200 feet and
                landing it, although the undercarriage collapsed. The frame was built out of pine and bamboo and was
                covered by Japanese silk. It was powered by a V-8 engine.</p>

            <h3>Marquis Multiplane 1907</h3>
            <p>In the early days of flight, the Marquis d'Ecquevilly tested the concept that more wings were better than
                two. After being destroyed by a fire in June 1908, d'Ecquevilly rebuilt the design with fifty pairs of
                wings instead of six, but this design never successfully flew either.</p>

            <p>The German airship Hindenberg made 30 successful trans-Atlantic flights before disaster struck in New
                Jersey in 1937. Filled with hydrogen, a highly inflammable gas, it exploded upon landing, killing 35
                passangers and crew.</p>
